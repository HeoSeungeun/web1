  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element" target="_blank" title="html5">I love movies.</a> because movies make me feel
  <strong>lifefull and sometimes it motivate</strong>
  me for escape <u>depressing</u>.
  Movies have a lot of genre such as action, romance,
  comedy, drama, thriller and so on.
  <img src="movie.jpg" width="50%">
  </p><p style = "margin-top:45px;">Among them i like most action genre because of its
  unreality. It makes me feel comfortable and active.
  When i see action movies, i think be the host of the movie.
  Actually not, that feeling make me relax.
  While watching movies, reality in my life is vanished.</p>
